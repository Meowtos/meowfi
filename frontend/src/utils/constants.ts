        ques: "What is NFT lending?",
        ans: "NFT lending allows users to use their NFTs (non-fungible tokens) as collateral to borrow cryptocurrency. By locking their NFTs into a lending platform, users can access liquidity without selling their digital assets."
    },
    {
        ques: "How does the NFT lending process work?",
        ans: "Borrowers pledge their NFTs as collateral on the platform. Lenders offer cryptocurrency loans based on the value of the NFT. If the borrower repays the loan with interest, they get their NFT back. If not, the lender can claim the NFT."
    },
    {
        ques: "What types of NFTs can be used as collateral?",
        ans: "The types of NFTs eligible for lending depend on the platform. Commonly accepted NFTs include high-value digital art, game items, virtual land, and collectibles from popular projects like Bored Ape Yacht Club or CryptoPunks."
    },
    {
        ques: "How is the value of my NFT determined?",
        ans: "The value of an NFT is usually determined by its current market price, historical sales, rarity, and demand. Some platforms may use oracle services or third-party evaluators to estimate the value of the NFT."
    },
    {
        ques: "What happens if I can't repay the loan?",
        ans: "If the loan is not repaid within the agreed-upon time frame, the lender typically gains full ownership of the NFT. This is similar to how traditional loans work with collateral."
